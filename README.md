## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / REPORT EXCERPT
DoReMi Books Inc. is a company started in 1955 (and is now 57 years old) and specializes in the supply and sale of classical music scores and music books in the USA with subsidiaries in the major cities of each of the 50 states. As a traditional industry, some of its business processes are manual and rather traditional. With the rapid development of the information technology (IT), especially the fast popularize and spread of Internet technology, the company is now facing strong competition from its competitors (both new and old), who have embraced online and internet sales as the new way of interacting and transacting with their customers.

In response to the new challenges brought on by online sales transactions, the company decided to conduct a business process improvement exercise to revamp their music books sale transaction and order handling process as well as introduce improved stock and inventory planning and management capabilities. This will include a new order handling process, an internet sales transaction system and an advanced business intelligence module for optimal stock inventory and warehousing forecasting.

Based on machine reasoning concepts and how logical rules and knowledge can be inferred with a reasoning based system, our group of five members, brainstormed and decided to build a system with hybrid architecture (NRules Engine and Web MVC technology) and automate, as much as we can, the business or functions based on the knowledge gleaned from: (a) feedback from the management board,  (b) current order handling processes and, (c) business issues encountered in current existing process. 

We set out first by getting a good understanding of the overall key processes of the proposed solution by mapping them out with data acquisition modelling. We then determined the areas of improvements that we agreed should be implemented into the new business processes. We also make sure we analyse the processes with our improvements and see how these improvements would be handled with test cases to validate our assumptions.

Our primary objective is to solve the business problems which are typically encountered in many traditional businesses which naturally includes DoReMi’s books ordering business processes.
